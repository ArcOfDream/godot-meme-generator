# godot-meme-generator

*Notice*: This really old and silly project was a product of one sitting in IT class. As a result, this project is basically not very helpful as it is. Currently pending a rewrite.

A tiny project that helps make memes quickly. Most of the images are made with the 500x500 size in mind.
This was made with the 2.1 version of Godot.
